# Variety-show-analysis

This project was created for me to develop a statistical analysis on reality TV shows such as variety shows and romance drama such as the Bachelor, Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradis.

Data will be collected from a variety of sourvces, from myself watching the shows and saving my observations in tabular forms on Excel files or CSV formatted files, to files written by web scraping different websites.  Data from these sites are only collected for pure interest and not for monetary gain.

All sources will be cited in the next markdown file.
